This is an clone of Settlers of Catan that was developed using Python and PyGame. Inspired by and created during ConUHacks IV. The current release contains all core features of Ceten.

## Installation Guidelines.
If you want to download and use Ceten, you will need to install Python 3.6+. Additionally, you also need to download pip and to download pygame by executing the command `pip install pygame`. It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment when installing these components.

## Executing Ceten.
After installing the necessary components, you can start Ceten by executing `python Ceten.py` in the directory Ceten.py resides in. Do not move the location of the scripts in relation to Ceten.py since it relies on them to utilize the implemented components of Ceten.
